From [Wekan forum post][wekan_forum_post]:

> QUESTION: What is the command to delete all Archived cards from all boards that is order than 60days old.

> I think if we can just delete all archived cards from all boards this will speed up our WEKAN again.

> We found out what's causing the system to slow down. The system slows down because of the accumulation of "Activities". So in your modification it might be cool if the activities can be deleted also
